 🌱 Phase 1: Prerequisites (1-2 Weeks)
Before diving into Spring Boot, ensure you're comfortable with:  
✅ Core Java – OOPs, Collections, Streams, Exception Handling  -- Done
✅ JDBC – Basic database connectivity in Java  -- Learn JPA
✅ Maven/Gradle – Dependency management  -- Done
✅ Basic SQL – CRUD operations using MySQL/PostgreSQL  -- Done

 🚀 Phase 2: Spring Boot Fundamentals (2-3 Weeks)
🔹 Set up a Spring Boot Project (Use Spring Initializr)   -- Done
🔹 Understand Annotations (`@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, `@Service`, etc.)   -- Done
🔹 Build Your First REST API using `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`  
🔹 Work with JSON & Postman for testing APIs  
🔹 Use Lombok for reducing boilerplate code

 🗄️ Phase 3: Database & JPA (2 Weeks)
🔹 Spring Data JPA & Hibernate – ORM for database interaction  
🔹 CRUD with MySQL/PostgreSQL  
🔹 Use `@Entity`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, `@Controller` annotations

🔹 OAuth2 for Third-Party Logins (Google, GitHub, etc.)  
🔹 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  

---

 ☁️ Phase 5: Advanced Concepts (4+ Weeks)
🔹 Microservices Architecture – Break applications into smaller services  
🔹 Spring Boot + Kafka/RabbitMQ – Event-driven communication  
🔹 Spring Cloud (Eureka, API Gateway, Config Server)  
🔹 Docker + Kubernetes for Deployment  
🔹 Unit Testing with JUnit & Mockito

 🛠️ Tools to Learn Along the Way
📌 Postman – API Testing  
📌 Git & GitHub – Version Control  
📌 Docker – Containerization  
📌 Swagger – API Documentation  
📌 CI/CD (Jenkins/GitHub Actions) – Automation

 🔥 Final Project (Capstone)
By the end, aim to build a full-fledged Spring Boot project, such as:  
✔️ E-commerce Platform (Products, Cart, Orders, Payments)  
✔️ Blogging System (Users, Posts, Comments, Authentication)  
✔️ Hospital Management System (Doctors, Patients, Appointments)
